Heritage Treasures: An In-Depth Analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Tableau

Heritage Treasures: An In-Depth Analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Tableau is a data visualization project designed to explore, analyze, and present global heritage data using Tableau.
The project evaluates how cultural, historical, and natural heritage sites are distributed across the world and how factors such as geography, category, and year of inscription influence preservation trends recognized by UNESCO.
Project Overview

In today’s globalized world, protecting cultural and natural heritage is essential for preserving human history and biodiversity. However, information about heritage sites is often scattered across multiple datasets and reports, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights.

This project addresses that challenge by transforming UNESCO World Heritage data into interactive dashboards and story-driven visualizations that allow users to explore patterns, trends, and regional contributions to global heritage conservation.
Key Objectives

Analyze the global distribution of World Heritage Sites.

Compare cultural, natural, and mixed site categories.

Track year-wise growth in heritage site recognition.

Identify top contributing countries and regions.

Provide insights into heritage concentration and preservation priorities
Example Sites Highlighted in the Analysis

The dashboard includes globally renowned landmarks such as:

Taj Mahal – A symbol of cultural heritage in India.

Great Wall of China – One of the largest architectural achievements in history.

Machu Picchu – A significant natural and cultural archaeological site.

These examples help users understand how heritage recognition spans continents and civilizations.
